# UBER-INSIGHTS-HUB
Designed and implemented the Uber Insights Hub to provide comprehensive analysis of customer reviews and operational data. Utilized Python for sentiment analysis to categorize Uber reviews into positive and negative sentiments, simplifying the interpretation of customer feedback. Developed SQL queries to extract detailed insights, such as identifying the most frequented destinations, peak hours of service, fare patterns, and cancellation rates. The project enabled a deeper understanding of both customer experiences and operational trends, ultimately improving service quality, optimizing operational efficiency, and driving data-informed decisions.
